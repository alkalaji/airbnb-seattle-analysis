# Seattle Airbnb dataset analysis
This repository is for project 1 of Udacity's data science nano degree

## Introduction
In this notebook, we look at the data provided by Airbnb for their listings in Seattle. We follow CRISP-DM in order to answer different busines questions.

## Motivation
Pricing is one of the most difficult tasks when listing a property. Therefore, through this analysis we want to look at pricing from a high-level all the way down to the factors that directly determine pricing.

## Data
The data used in this project should be downloaded from the following link:

## Requirements
